<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">GIS layers that are shared with the public should have their metadata updated before sharing. The text below is the metadata used for the main five layers. It would be better to be able to export and inport this information into a feature class but we don't currently know how. So, cut and paste is the only way at the moment. </span><br />

Oakland Bikeway Network, bikeways, bike lanes, bike routes, bike paths<br />
<br />
Summary (Purpose)<br />
Bikeways are corridors designated for bicycle travel. This layer includes Oakland’s Proposed Bikeway Network, streets proposed for bicycle improvements in the 2007 Bicycle Master Plan, as well as a small number of bikeways added or removed from the proposed network since then.<br />
<br />
Bikeways are defined by &quot;class,&quot; each with specific characteristics (see Definition). The fields “Proposed Class” and “ExistingClass” show the proposed and current state of the network, based on these class definitions. For some existing bikeways, the proposed bikeway class is not the same as the existing class. Two additional layers (ProposedBikeways and ExistingBikeways), subsets of the Bikeway Network, are also available.<br />
<br />
Designations reflect existing and proposed designations as of <span style="background-color: #1edeb0;">Month Day, Year</span><br />
<br />
Definition (abstract)<br />
Class type (0, 1, 2, 2.1, 3, 3A, or 3B) appears in the ProposedClass and ExistingClass fields.<br />
Class 1 = bike paths, paved rights-of-way that are completely separated from the street, and typically shared with pedestrians.<br />
<br />
Class 2 = bike lanes, lanes striped on streets and designated specifically for bicyclists. (Class 2.1 indicates bike lanes in one direction only on a two-way street.)<br />
<br />
Class 3 = bike routes, streets on which bicyclists share travel lanes with drivers and are designated by wayfinding signage only.<br />
<br />
Class 3A = arterial bike routes, bikeways on busier streets where bike lanes are not possible, and parallel streets do not provide adequate connectivity. Oakland’s Class 3A facilities are designated with sharrows, parking edgeline striping or Tees, and wayfinding signage.<br />
<br />
Class 3B = bike boulevards, bikeways on residential streets that prioritize through trips for bicyclists. Oakland’s Class 3B facilities are designated with sharrow markings, traffic calming measures, and wayfinding signage.<br />
<br />
Class 0 = no bikeway is proposed or existing, as applicable. (There are four segments that are currently existing, but not proposed.)<br />

Tags: Oakland Bikeway Network, bikeways, bike lanes, bike routes, bike paths<br />
<br />
Summary (Purpose)<br />
Bikeways are corridors designated for bicycle travel. This layer includes a subset of the Proposed Bikeway Network, streets proposed for bicycle improvements in the 2007 Bicycle Master Plan. The subset is where bikeway improvements have been completed since plan adoption as well as a small number of segments added since then.<br />
Bikeways are defined by &quot;class,&quot; each with specific characteristics (see Definition). The fields “Proposed Class” and “ExistingClass” show the proposed and current state of the network, based on these class definitions. Two additional layers, ProposedBikeways (segments that haven’t yet been completed or are planned for updgrades) and Bikeway Network (all the existing and proposed bikeways in Oakland), are also available.<br />
