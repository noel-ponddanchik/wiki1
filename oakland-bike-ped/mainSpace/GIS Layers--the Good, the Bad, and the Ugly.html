Not all layers are created equal. And, unfortunately, some of the layers that are available, have erroneous information and/or are not managed on an ongoing basis. An analysis of the various layers that the bike/ped program uses is in the spreadsheet at<br />
\\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\GIS\1-HowTo\List_of_Used_GIS_Layers.xlsx.<br />
<br />
Before using GIS data for a particular map or project, it is a good idea to check this list and use only the recommended data and to check in with Jennifer or another intern. If new data sources are found to be good and relevant this list should be updated after the integrity of the data has been confirmed.<br />
<br />
As of 2/11/15, the list is a work in progress. Layers that are not bike/ped program initiated and managed may move and change when the City starts working in the ArcGIS online platform.
