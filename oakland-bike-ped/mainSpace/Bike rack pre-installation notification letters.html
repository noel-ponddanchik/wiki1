<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Prior to the installation of bike rack(s), the City mails the fronting business and allows two weeks for comment. As of 11/30/15, a generic letter is mailed, customized with the mailing and respond-by dates. The dates are entered in the database and, once the respond-by date is passed, the work can be added to the next work order.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Tasks are:</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Update the database to include the mailing and respond by dates of relevant rack(s)/sites. Use the q3Mailing to make sure all needed fields are completed.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Copy the relevant rows into an Excel spreadsheet and save temporarily on the Desktop.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Open the letters-template at \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Projects\Bike_Parking\letters. Update the file with the mailing date and the respond by date (typically two weeks hence). Cut and paste the letter recipients from Excel table onto page 2, deleting the table currently there. Print as many copies of the first page as needed to mail to the recipients. Make a .pdf of the two page file and append it to &quot;CR-letters_Jan-JunYr_ongoing&quot; or CR-letters_Jul-DecYr_ongoing&quot; as relevant. </span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Create mailing envelopes by merging addresses with the temporary spreadsheet into the &quot;merge-envelope-template&quot; file. Print via manual feed and load the envelopes as per the printer.</span></li><li>Use the q3Mailing to change the Timeline to Mailed when the letter is mailed, and add the ResponseDate (respond by date).</li><li>If the property owner is being mailed (atypical), the address can be found at <span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://mapsengine.google.com/14521865428290491196-00324055791539252720-4/mapview/?pli=1" rel="nofollow">https://mapsengine.google.com/14521865428290491196-00324055791539252720-4/mapview/?pli=1</a>. The address and other property owner information should be added to the database, and a line to the Excel table to document that they were contacted.</span></li></ul>
