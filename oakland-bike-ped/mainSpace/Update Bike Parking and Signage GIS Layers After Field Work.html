<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">When doing field verifications of installations or repairs of bike racks or wayfinding signs, one may come across instances where:</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">the location of the bike rack or wayfinding sign does not match the location shown in the GIS layer, or</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">there is no point in the GIS layer for the observed bike rack or wayfinding sign.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Bi-annual update of layers</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">In these instances, one should update the layer.</span><br />
