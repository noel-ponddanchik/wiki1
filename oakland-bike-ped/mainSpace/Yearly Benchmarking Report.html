<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Each year we are asked to give </span>the League of American Bicyclist's updated center-line mile data about our on road bike facilities. Questions about the facilities are separate by facility type, then by speed range. Answers need to be in centerline miles - to reduce double counting, we established a hierarchy of bike facility types:<br />
<ol><li>Cycletracks and Protected Bike Lanes</li><li>Buffered Bike Lanes</li><li>Regular Bike Lanes</li><li>Sharrows (Class 3A only)</li></ol><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><div id="toc"><h1 class="nopad">Table of Contents</h1><div style="margin-left: 1em;"><a href="#Methodology">Methodology </a></div>

The shapefile used to determine centerline miles for each bike facility is our Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) shapefile. The shapefile is located here:<br />
\\PWAFILE2\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Projects\LTS\GIS\Shapefiles\Current<br />
<br />
A List of each Field Headings meanings are found in our Project Documentation (Meanings are at end of Document):<br />

<ul><li>Use bikeway definitions provided in NACTO Bikeway Design Guidelines, then on Oakland's wiki page to determine hierarchy.<br />
- For example, we decided not to report unmarked Class 3 facilities as shared lane markings. Therefore only Class 3A was counted</li><li>Bicycle boulevards were counted but not included in the hierarchy as there wasn't any competition between the two sides of the street - they are whole-street treatments</li><li>Separate Class I facilities from all other facilities.<br />
- The League of American Bicyclists did not ask for these numbers by speed limit as they are separated facilities.</li><li>Separate One-Way from Two-Way Facilities</li><li>Separate Buffered Bike Lanes from Bike Lanes data</li><li>We decided that wide paved shoulders would not be counted</li><li>All segments with &quot;Right&quot; Directional Buffered Bike Lanes have either Regular or Buffered Bike Lanes on the &quot;Left&quot; side. These were counted as buffered.</li><li>Some segments with &quot;Left&quot; Directional Buffered Bike Lanes have &quot;Right&quot; Facilities with Class 3, 3A, or no bike lanes. Again, these were counted as buffered.</li><li>In all instances on two-way streets where Sharrows ('3A') exist on one side of the road, the other side has sharrows or a bike lane.<br />
- Therefore the lower total is being reported for sharrows</li><li>Special calculation was used for Class II non-buffered bike lanes to determine how to calculate.</li><li>We took the &quot;greater&quot; number for each side in all cases except for Class II facilities.<br />
- The formula removes cases where buffered bike lanes are along the same segments as bike lanes, adds the left and right side and divides the total by 2</li></ul><h1 id="toc1"><a name="Questions from 2017 (Questions answered through the use of GIS)"></a>Questions from 2017 (Questions answered through the use of GIS)</h1>

First separate one way streets into a new shapefile. This can be done by running this query and exporting a new shapefile from selected features (Used for one side of street calcs).<br />
&quot;ONEWAY&quot; = 'FT' OR &quot;ONEWAY&quot; = 'TF'<br />
Then create a Shapefile for segments without the one-way tag (Used for both sides of street calcs).<br />
&quot;ONEWAY&quot; = ' '<br />

After each Select by Attribute is ran, look at the SHAPE_Leng column and right click on the column and select Summary. The Sum field will give you your answer in miles.<br />
