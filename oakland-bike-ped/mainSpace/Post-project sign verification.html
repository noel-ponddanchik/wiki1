 <br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">1. Gather sign plan list and map (photocopy docs in folder), clipboard, measuring tape/wheel, orange vest, writing implements, Jenniferâ€™s business card, phone.</span><br />
<br />
2. Review plan, map out route.<br />
<br />
3. Look at each sign and document any problems being sure to review for all of the following:<br />
<br />
a. wrong location<br />
<br />
b. too low/too high<br />
<br />
c. gap between blades<br />
<br />
d. wrong message or incorrect arrows/logos<br />
<br />
e. too much or not enough space between logos and text and/or edge of sign<br />
<br />
f. signs not removed<br />
<br />
g. bad location choice by us<br />
<br />
4. Photograph and get GPS coordinate for each sign using mobile App. Photos should show the full length of the pole to the top of the sign.<br />
<br />
5. Back in the office, update the following fields in Access: installed checkbox, Last Verified date, Photo (ID.jpg) and, if applicable, installation notes (for mistakes are too trivial to fix).<br />
<br />
6. If needed, create a punch list for items needing repair/fixing. The punch list template is the last tab in \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Projects\Bikeways-signage\1-resources\work-orders-general\work-order-overview-template.xls, a multi-tab file that is created for all corridor projects, and filed by corridor.<br />
<br />
7. File the photos by ID# in \oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Projects\Bikeways-signage\SignPhotos (e.g. 547.jpg). If lighting was poor, use Photoshop to lighten before filing.<br />
<br />
8. Link to GIS. See <a href="http://oakland-bike-ped.wikispaces.com/Update+Rack+and+Signage+GIS+Layers+After+Fieldwork">http://oakland-bike-ped.wikispaces.com/Update+Rack+and+Signage+GIS+Layers+After+Fieldwork</a>.
