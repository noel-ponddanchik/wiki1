<ol><li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Open the main table in the WayfindingSigns database: </span><strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Tables</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">à</span>tSigns.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> If necessary, assign any existing assemblies along the corridor to another corridor (to delete them from the field sheet). If these will be returned to their original corridors after the Project, make a note of this in the Notes field.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Assign a ProjectSort number to all assembly locations in the project corridor, so that the records will appear in the order that the field work will be performed (e,g. from the northmost point of a corridor to the southmost point, and then back again). Sort the ProjectSort column A-Z.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Go to </span><strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Advanced Filter Sort</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> (this is in different locations depending on the version of Access), and build a query that includes only &quot;Corridor&quot; and &quot;ProjectSort.&quot; Save the filter as a query by clicking the box in the top left corner called &quot;Advanced&quot; and clicking &quot;Save as Query.&quot; Name the query appropriately: &lt;qProjectTitle&gt;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Go to the Reports section. Right click on </span><strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">r1TEMPLATE_FieldReview,</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"> copy it, paste it, and rename it appropriately: &lt;r1_ProjectName&gt;. It will appear in the table of contents with its new name.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Open your new r1 in Design View (by right clicking the header and selecting &quot;Design View&quot;).</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">In Report Header, change the name of the report to match the corridor name. Right click the black square in the upper left corner and select &quot;Properties.&quot; The “Property Sheet” window will pop up in the upper right hand corner (or select it from the main menu). Select the Data tab, and change the Record Source to the query you just created from the pull down menu.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Arial Black',Gadget,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Right click the black square in the top left corner again, and go to &quot;Report View.&quot; Review to see that the report looks correct. If not, go back to an earlier step to fix the issue. Once satisfied, export to .pdf (various methods). Save the pdf to the appropriate project folder, and print a copy for the manila project folder.</span></li></ol><h1 id="toc1"> </h1>

<ul><li>Bring: printed field review sheet, removals list and overview map, camera, distance roller, pen/pencil(s), white spray paint, clip board or binder, wayfinding guidelines. <a class="wiki_link" href="Wayfinding%20Sign%20Site%20inspection%20and%20Verification%20Process.html">Wayfinding Sign Site Inspection Guidelines</a></li><li>Find sign locations, favoring existing poles with no more than one sign—or one side-by-side assembly—on them. If a new pole is required, do not site directly adjacent to a building’s utility connections (look on the side of the building). Site, if possible, between two dwellings (to minimize the impact on either); outside of expensively landscaped verges; at least five feet from hydrants and curb ramps, and three feet from driveways.</li><li>Mark locations with a carrot (^) on the curb and the sign ID number on the pavement (these steps may not be possible if a car is parked there).</li><li>Make notes in the “Installation Notes” field, capturing the adjacent property address (if available), and other descriptive and salient information. Make notes in other fields if changes were made, to cross streets, for example. Make sure to tally new poles.</li><li><em>Photograph all locations</em>. If undecided about a particular site, take photos that document the pros/cons, highlight in notes, and discuss w/ supervisor back in the office.</li></ul><br />

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 12.7272720336914px;">Typically the field review will require significant edits made to the plan documents prior to sending a final work order to the installers. Actual conditions like the quality of the sidewalk, the presence of trees and low-hanging branches, and the proximity of bus loading zones, among myriad other things, are difficult to anticipate using GIS.</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 12.7272720336914px;">Using the notes made on the field review sheet and on the paper copy of the draft sign plan map, update the Access database, the sign plan .pdf, and the WayfindingSignage layer in the GIS.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 12.7272720336914px;">Installer instructions should always be written in the following order (to ensure that all aspects of the description are included and can be quickly reviewed; see Bay Trail work order for example):</span><ol><li>Pole description including the words “existing” or “new” for sign poles (vs electroliers—which should have ID numbers), and whether the pole is round or square (the assumption is that round poles will be replaced with square poles)</li><li>Location, including address if available, and/or distance from landmark;</li><li>Blade placement (if not standard)</li></ol></li></ul><br />
<ul><li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 12.7272720336914px;">The sign plan .pdf must be accurate enough to aid the installers—make sure each sign is on the correct side of the street and on the right block. Sub-meter precision is not necessary—the sidewalk will be marked with spray paint to provide the exact location for the installers.</span></li></ul><h2 id="toc5"> </h2>
