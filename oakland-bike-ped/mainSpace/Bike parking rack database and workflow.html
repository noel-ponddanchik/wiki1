<em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">These instructions assume a basic working knowledge of Microsoft Access. Last updated 2/16/16</span></em><br />

<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Pre-defined queries in Access facilitate data entry and work flow. They are not required--all work can be done from the main table--but they show the key information for the work phase, providing clarify in an otherwise cluttered database. Queries include a subset of all the fields in the main table (tBikeParking)--those relevant to the particular phase in the work flow, and other identifying fields. It is important to complete every <em><strong>relevant</strong></em> field in each query--otherwise, subsequent queries and/or reports will be incomplete. (Some fields are not &quot;relevant&quot; but remain as identifiers.)</span><br />
<br />
<em><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Key queries and reports (as of February 2016):</span></strong></span></em><br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">q1 Enter Request: (1) enter new requests (feeds into &quot;r1Locations to Inspect&quot; report for field inspections) AND (2) change Timeline status to Inspected after inspections</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">q2 Field Inspection (enter installation instructions, number of racks, racks type(s), survey date and other relevant info after location has been surveyed)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">q3Mailing (prepare envelopes for letters to business owners; also change the Status to Mailed and enter Respond by date)</span></li><li>q3ToVerify (once racks have been installed; FIRST change the Status from In Progress to Installed)</li><li>q4 Work Order. This query is used at two points: (1) to generate work orders for installations, and (2) to change the status from In-Progress to Installed and teh Timeline to &quot;Installed to verify&quot; after racks are installed. Records only appear in this query if the site has been inspected AND the response deadline has passed. These milestones mean that the location is ready to be included in a new work order. To make this work, change the Timeline status to Work Order, and check the Work Order check box. [In the future it would be good to get ride of the check box--for now, queries and reports depend on both. I think.]</li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">q3ToVerify: a report with records that have been installed. After these locations have been verified in the field, use the field verification query (Q3) and fill in all the fields. </span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">qNeighborhood-Verification (document installation and ensure all needed information is entered into the database. </span><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Make sure every field is completed</strong></span></em><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> (except where there is no relevant information, like the Notes or Suite Number fields).</span></li></ul><br />

<strong><em><u>Updating GIS:</u></em></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Once a rack location has been installed and field verified, make sure to create the location in the master geodatabase; see</span><br />

<strong><em>Defunct Reports:</em></strong><br />
<u><span style="line-height: 1.5;">r3 Work Order-New Installs</span></u><span style="line-height: 1.5;">: creates a work order for any sites that have been field inspected AND the letter response deadline of two weeks has passed.</span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">r4 Work Order - Repairs</span></u><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">: </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">generates a list of sites that have been determined to be in need of repairs.
