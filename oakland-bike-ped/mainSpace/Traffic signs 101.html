<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Traffic signs are described in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (a good description of the MUTCD is at </span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_on_Uniform_Traffic_Control_Devices" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_on_Uniform_Traffic_Control_Devices</a></span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">.</span><br />

California is one of the states that has its own version of the MUTCD. As of September 2015, the last approved version was in 2014: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/traffops/engineering/mutcd/ca_mutcd2014.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/traffops/engineering/mutcd/ca_mutcd2014.htm</a>. Signs are in Chapter 2. Bike stuff (both signs and striping) are in Chapter 9. Engineers and planners, generally speaking, like to comply w/ the MUTCD unless there is a compelling and documented reason to do otherwise.<br />
<br />
Signs fall into the following generally categories:<br />
<br />
<ul><li><strong>Regulatory</strong>, generally black print on a white blade, but also STOP and YIELD signs, as well as No Parking, BIKE LANE, and Street Sweeping signs. These signs indicate laws that you can be fined for breaking.</li><li><strong>Warning</strong>, generally black on yellow.</li><li><strong>Guide/recreational</strong>. Green, sometimes brown. Our wayfinding signs are guide signs.</li><li><strong>Temporary traffic control</strong>, black on orange. These are sometimes versions of the other signs on an orange blade and are used during construction projects to indicate a temporary change to the road condition.</li></ul><br />
