<strong>Workflow Overview:</strong><br />
Isolate the project polygon&gt; Use this polygon to select the project's bikeway segments&gt; Apply edits<br />
<ul><li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;">First, double click on <strong>bikeprojectmanagement</strong> layer in the table of contents. In the <strong>Layer Properties</strong>, navigate to the <strong>Definition Query</strong> tab. </span><ul><li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;">Click the <strong>Query Builder</strong> button, double click <strong>ProjectID</strong>, press the <strong>=</strong> button, and the <strong>Get Unique Values</strong> button. </span></li><li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;">Double click on the project value you are interested in selecting the segments within. </span></li><li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;">Your '<strong>SELECT*FROM bikeprojectmanagement WHERE:</strong>' query should be 'ProjectID = 5&quot; (5 being an example project polygon of interest). </span></li><li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;">Press <strong>OK</strong>, you should now only see the project polygon of interest displayed in the map.</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;">Now go to <strong>Select</strong> at the top menu bar and choose <strong>Select</strong></span><strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;"> By Location</span></strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;">.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Extra Bikeway Class Detail&lt;/span&gt;
Value: 0 = No bikeway
* Description: Either no bikeway exists or no bikeway is proposed for a particular roadway segment. For Existing Class 0, the Proposed Class is generally not 0. In some instances an existing bikeway (Existing Class does not equal 0) is proposed to be removed (Proposed Class 0). Segments with both Existing Class 0 and Proposed Class 0 were analyzed as part of the 2007 Bicycle Master Plan but not included as part of the bike network.
Value: 1 = bike path
* Description: Provides a paved right-of-way that is completely separated from the street. Bike paths are typically shared with pedestrians and are often called mixes-use paths.
Value: 2= bike lane
* Description: Striped on streets and designated specifically for bicyclists. They are Oakland's preferred treatment for busy streets.
Value: 2.1 = Bike lane on one side only
* Description: This designation is used for one bike lane on only one side of a two-way street. Note that a one-way street with one bike lane is designated as Class 2. Class 2.1 is used to imply unfinished business - a bike lane is still needed on the street.
Value: 3 = bike route
* Description: Have shared travel lanes and are designated because they provide better connectivity than other nearby streets. Bike routes are designated with bikeway guide signs and may have no other bicycle-specific features. The 2007 Bicycle Master Plan proposes bike routes only in the Oakland Hills above Mountain Blvd due to the recreational nature and challenging topography of this area. The bikeways in the rest of the city are proposed for bikeways that provide a higher level of accommodation (Class 1, 2, 3B).
Value: 3A = arterial bike route
* Description: Located on busier streets where bike lanes are not possible and parallel streets do not provide adequate connectivity. They include sharrows and bicycle-specific signage. Arterial bike routes are used to make near-term connections in the bike network. Over time they should be replaced with better facilities (e.g., Class 2).
Value: 3B = bicycle boulevard
* Description: Prioritizes bicyclists on quiet residential streets with traffic calming, sharrows, and bicycle guide signs.
Value: 4 = Proposed bikeway
* Description: This class is an artifact of the &quot;I [bike] Oakland&quot; map to identify proposed bikeways with wide travel lanes or low traffic volumes that provide useful connections in their current form. These streets are generally proposed for Class 2 or Class 3B facilities. These Class 4 bikeways are tracked in the GIS layer as a subset of all proposed bikeways so as mileage can be computed for the cover of the &quot;I [bike] Oakland&quot; map.
