<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Development of the annual &quot;I [bike] Oakland&quot; bikeways map is, generally,a three-month process though notes are maintained throughout the year as ideas and observations are made by staff. Following are detailed instructions:</span><br />
<br />
<hr />
<strong><em>Year round</em></strong><br />
<ul><li>Maintain a running list of updates in the directory for the map year in <span style="line-height: 1.5;">\\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Outreach\Maps\IbikeOakland</span></li><li>Track the number of boxes mailed to individual shops and given to the Mayor’s office, distributed at events, etc. using a spreadsheet in the map year folder named 20XX-production-distribution. This is, in part, to determine if the map quantity needs to be increased for the subsequent year.</li><li>Track the totals from year to year in this spreadsheet: <span style="line-height: 1.5;">\\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Outreach\Maps\IbikeOakland\Ibike-map_production_ongoing.xls</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Monitor quantity and evaluate the need to reprint. </span><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><em>Do not reprint after March 1st.</em></span></span></strong></li></ul><br />
<strong><em>January</em></strong><br />
Create map project schedule (using the prior year Excel file as template).<br />
<br />
<strong><em>February</em></strong><br />
Email neighboring cities for changes. Use the email sent the prior year as a template. The following was sent to<br />
'Anderson, Eric' &lt;EAnderson@ci.berkeley.ca.us&gt;; 'Gail Payne' &lt;GPayne@ci.alameda.ca.us&gt;; 'jchang@ci.piedmont.ca.us'; 'RChen@sanleandro.org'; 'Sara Billing' &lt;sbilling@ci.emeryville.ca.us&gt; on February 3, 2015.<br />
<br />
<em>Hey neighbors,</em><br />
<br />
<em>The City of Oakland is updating our Bikeways Map for release at the end of April 2015 (in time for Bike to Work Day). We are looking for anything that has changed in your city since March 2014 (when you last provided input). This information includes:</em><br />
<br />
<ul><li><em>new bikeways that will <strong>definitely</strong> be installed by May 2015, by Class: 1, 2, and 3 (as usual), plus 3A (sharrows on an arterial street); and 3B (bike boulevard)</em></li><li><em>new bike shops, and</em></li><li><em>bike shops that have gone out of business.</em></li></ul><br />
<em>If you would be so kind as to <strong>send a list of changes no later than March 4, 2015</strong> that would be great.</em><br />
<br />
<em>If you have a list of things that have changed and you feel it’s too time-consuming to review the 2014 map (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PWA/o/EC/s/BicycleandPedestrianProgram/OAK046683" rel="nofollow">west side for Berkeley, Piedmont, and Emeryville</a>; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca1/groups/pwa/documents/marketingmaterial/oak046684.pdf" rel="nofollow">east side for Alameda and San Leandro</a>) you don’t need to review it (though we appreciate the extra QA/QC).</em><br />
<br />
<em>The map is distributed through Oakland bike shops, and, at the Berkeley Bikestation and Alameda Bicycles.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Thanks so much for your help, and please let me know if you have any questions,</em><br />
<br />
<strong><em>March</em></strong><br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Contact bike shops and other current map outlets to determine quantities for shipping to each location (needed for print quote)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Get date for the Bike East Bay bag stuffing (to include in map print specs).</span></li><li>Finalize total map quantity and submit PO request using last year's request as a template. Printer can be selected using Copy Services’ CPO (more expensive) or by getting three bids (time intensive). See examples from previous years in the folder. (The last time staff solicited bids was 2012.)</li><li>First week of March: email revisions to Jake, including updated cover file. Expect draft by mid-March. Final comments to Jake at the end of March.</li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Email bike shops with a survey regarding number of boxes desired (which might include other Bike Month inquiries, including BikeBucks). Use direct mail or </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" rel="nofollow">Survey Monkey</a></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">. If needed, update list of bike shops at </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/OAK024707" rel="nofollow">http://www2.oaklandnet.com/OAK024707</a></span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span>See schedule for template-driven milestones for design and printing.</li></ul><br />
<strong>Map print specifications</strong><br />

<strong><em>April</em></strong><br />
<ul><li>Contact selected printer and confirm printing milestones.</li><li>Tighten up delivery list and convey to printer; maps should be delivered to shops no later than May 1 (and no earlier than April 30). The point is to launch the map for Bike Month in May.</li><li>Post reduced file size map on website at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PWA/o/EC/s/BicycleandPedestrianProgram/OAK024652#map" rel="nofollow">http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PWA/o/EC/s/BicycleandPedestrianProgram/OAK024652#map</a>; maybe post announcement on home page, too.</li></ul><br />
<strong><em>NOTE ON CALCULATING MILEAGE</em></strong>:<br />
As of 2015, the map designer, Jake Coolidge, is calculating the total map mileage, including that for adjoining jurisdictions. The bikeways database reliably calculates the mileage for Oakland (run database report rBikeway_network_mileage_summary and use existing centerline miles). Mileage for the bikeways in adjoining jurisdictions has proved difficult, in part because it needs to include only the mileage shown on the map. Jake is under contract through 2016. Should there be a different designer in the future who cannot calculate the mileage for adjoining jurisdictions, following are past instructions for doing so, should they prove helpful:<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">GIS Layer (adj_bikeways):</span></strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file://pwafile1/pwa/Divisions_and_Teams/Transportation/Bike-Ped_Program/GIS" rel="nofollow">\GIS\master.gdb</a></span><br />
<strong>Map location:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file://pwafile2/Transportation/Bike-Ped_Program/GIS/adjoining_jurisdictions/printMap_totals.mxd" rel="nofollow">\GIS\adjoining_jurisdictions\printMap_totals.mxd</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">1. Update ‘adj_bikeways’ to reflect any changes in the past year<br />
2. Create a new clipped layer from updated ‘adj_bikeways’:</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Open ArcToolbox &gt; Analysis Tools &gt; Extract &gt; Clip</span></li><li>Input Features = adj_bikeways</li><li>Clip Features = printMap_boundary</li><li>Output Feature Class = adj_bikeways_clip(<em>n</em>)</li></ul><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">3. Calculate mileage from the new layer:</span><br />
<ul><li>Open adj_bikeways_clip(<em>n</em>) attribute table</li><li>Select by attribute where “EXCLASS” &lt;&gt; 0</li><li>Right-click on field Shape_Length &gt; Statistics</li><li>Take the sum (ft) divided by 5280<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[b1] </span> (the number of feet in a mile)</li></ul>
