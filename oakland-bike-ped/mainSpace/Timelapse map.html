This project reflects the increase in bikeway mileage and the changes to bikeway types (Class) starting in 1976 (when the first bike route signs are thought to have been installed). The maps are posted on the Completed Projects page of the bike programâ€™s website (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="file://oakland/pwa/Transportation/Bike-Ped_Program/GIS/timelapse/www2.oaklandnet.com/government/OAK024591" rel="nofollow">www2.oaklandnet.com/government/OAK024591</a> and used in various outreach efforts as desired.<br />
Specific outputs are: <br />
<ol><li>Individual .pdf maps for each calendar year starting in 1976, except for those years between 1977 and 1996 when there were no changes to the network: 1977, 1979, 1981-86, 1989, 1991, 1992, and 1994-96.</li><li>Packet of the above maps, updated annully</li><li>Individual .png maps for web animation at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PWA/s/BicycleandPedestrianProgram/Map1/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PWA/s/BicycleandPedestrianProgram/Map1/index.htm</a>.</li><li>Tables and charts illustrating the changes based on data in the timelapse database.</li></ol><br />
The project requires that updates be made in four locations: (1) timelapse database; (2) timelapse GIS layer/geodatabase; (3) bikeways segments database; (4) bikeways GIS layer (master geodatabase).<br />
<br />
Updates will be made in January (or February) of each year. <br />
