<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The preliminary project map is the 35% benchmark of the <a class="wiki_link" href="Sign%20Plan%20Process.html">sign planning process.</a> and is a direct outcome of the work completed during the </span><a class="wiki_link" href="Sign%20Plan%20Overview%20Map%20How-To">Overview Map</a> <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">(15%) phase. The Project Map includes the new signs with their messaging along the corridor of interest and existing signs that demonstrate relevant network continuity. New sign records are created in Access, and corresponding points are added to ArcMap. A draft of the map is exported from ArcMap and finished in Illustrator.</span><br />

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The particular destinations that will be printed on each sign were selected during development of the <a class="wiki_link" href="Sign%20Plan%20Overview%20Map%20How-To">Overview Map</a>. Consult this map for (1) the exact destinations to include on <em><strong>decision</strong></em> signs (spelled out by the black arrows indicating destinations to support now), and (2) choices for <em><strong>confirmation</strong></em> signs (options for which are spelled out in the boxes that accompany colored lines along the route). Unless new bikeway striping has been installed since the Overview Map was finalized, the map designer has no choice about which destinations to support on decision signs. Note that at intersections with proposed bikeways, select a turn sign (not a decision sign), unless otherwise specified in the Overview Map.</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Open the signage database is at \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Projects\Bikeways-signage\WayfindingSigns.accdb.</span></li><li>Open the table “tBikewayCorridors&quot; to confirm or add the corridor name. If it doesn't yet exist, add it based on the name in</li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">\\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Projects\Bikeways-project_tracking\signage-projects-status.xlsx, &quot;active projects&quot; tab. (The name may already exist.)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Before adding records to the database, it can be helpful to sketch out all the proposed signs and their destinations on the Overview Map and consider whether each follows the guidelines.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Open the tSigns table and add the new signs and relevant information. Many of the fields are pull down menus of options. Wayfinding assemblies are comprised of the main sign, the D11-1 BIKE ROUTE sign, and the D1-1b supplemental blade. For each D1-1b, indicate the sign message using the three provided fields. If a sign has only one destination, for example, “[ba] Fruitvale 0.2”, use the first field and leave the other two blank. The database includes numerous examples. Use the symbols ^, &lt;, and &gt; for arrows. Enter mileages for confirmation signs as “x.x” as a placeholder until the proper mileage is determined after the field work has been completed. Place “[ba]”, &quot;[bt],&quot; “[eb]”, “[H]”, &quot;[li]&quot;, and “[am]” where logos for BART, Bay Trail, EBRPD, hospitals, libraries, and Amtrak would appear on the sign. Complete all the relevant database fields. The following fields are needed for the next step. </span><ul><li>direction</li><li>street</li><li>cross street</li><li>side of intersection</li><li>sign messages (as described above).</li></ul></li><li>Assign a number to the sort order field, starting with “01” (or the next number if you are adding to a corridor and not creating a one). The sort order field will determine the order the records appear later on the work order.The sort order (and other fields) might change once field work is completed.</li><li><em>Style guide:</em> look at how other streets are named and follow that convention (e.g. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">for street suffixes, use St, Ave, Blvd, Wy (no period after).</span></li></ul><br />

<ul><li><em><strong>Do as much work as possible in GIS before exporting to Illustrator</strong></em> (as shown below). It is extremely time-consuming to go back to GIS once you enter the Illustrator phase. (Also, exporting to AI can be buggy, work-a-rounds from <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/gis/manual/illustrator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/gis/manual/illustrator/</a>.)<ul><li>Turn off any layers you do not want exported by unchecking their box in the ‘Table of Contents’</li><li>Make sure raster layers are at the bottom of the order</li><li>Once your map is prepped, select from the ‘File’ menu ‘Export Map’</li></ul></li><li>Choose ‘AI’ from the ‘Save as Type’ pull down</li><li>Click ‘Options’ button on lower left corner of export window</li><li>Navigate to ‘General Options’ tab and set DPI to 200</li><li>Navigate to ‘Format Options’ tab to set the ‘Destination Colorspace:’ to ‘CMYK’ and the ‘Picture Symbol’ pull-down to ‘Vectorize Bitmap or Picture Symbol Fills’</li><li>Make sure the ‘Convert Marker Symbols to Polygons’ is checked</li><li>Click ‘Save’</li><li>Open in Illustrator and click ‘Update’ to convert the fonts; Select Text Objects, then arrow key left twice and right twice.

<ul><li>The sign labels will be a bit of a jumbled mess at this point. Export the map to Illustrator as a .AI, but remember: once exported, the graphics in the Illustrator file will lose the link to the Access database. If you make significant edits to sign locations in ArcView and sign messages in Access, you may want to re-export the sign labels from ArcView, and edits in Illustrator will have to be re-done, so keep that in mind.</li><li>Illustrator needs to update the ArcView-created Illustrator file upon opening; select Update from the pop-up dialog to complete this.</li><li>The graphics are layered as they were in ArcView. Sometimes the artboard size gets lost in translation, and a tabloid layout opens with a letter-sized artboard, so fix this first.</li><li>Note the file name has been appended during the update with “[Converted]”. Save the document as an Illustrator-editable pdf, removing “[Converted]” from the filename. The Illustrator file can be deleted.</li><li>When working with graphics in Illustrator, note that ArcView has created a clipping mask on each layer. Use the Direct Selection tool (keyboard shortcut “A” or the white arrow) instead of the Selection Tool (“V”/black arrow) to avoid selecting all the features associated with a clipping mask. I select a sign label (both the green box and the text, using Shift), right click the selection, and select Transform<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">à</span>Rotate… I can then dial in a specific rotation, in degrees, and preview the change prior to committing. Along straight bikeways, the same rotation amount can be applied to subsequent selections. Illustrator calls up your previous rotation amount each time you enter the dialog.</li><li>Use the Direct Selection tool to also modify the callout/leader elements on each label, as necessary.</li><li>Complete the layout by adding a title and a legend. I typically open an older sign plan and copy and paste the necessary items to the new document. Once pasted, update the title and the revised date.</li><li>Callout boxes and dots for bike assemblies along nearby corridors will have been included in the export from GIS in grey. The Project Map should include some but not all of these: include only those that help us confirm continuity of messaging and delete the rest. Include existing decision signs on intersecting streets and the first (or second) existing confirmation sign after a decision sign along the Project route. Also, include existing BIKE LANE (R81) signs IF they are along the Project route to verify that no additional R81 signs will be needed.</li><li>Add the mileage legend (look at a recent map):</li></ul><br />
<ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Centerline miles: x.x mi (the length of the bikeway)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Directional miles: x.x mi (typically double the length of the bikeway, unless there are one-way streets or one-way route segments, which would lead to a smaller number)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Total Assemblies (#): all wayfinding assemblies on the plan map (do not count regulatory or warning signs in this number)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Corridor guide sign assemblies (#): assemblies being installed on the </span><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">corridor</span></strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">--even if more are being installed as part of the work order</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Corridor guide sign assemblies/directional mi (#): divide the number of corridor guide sign assemblies by directional miles (the objective pf #4 and #5 is to quickly assess the project's adherence to the sign spacing targets in the wayfinding guidelines)</span></li></ol><br />
<h3 id="toc7"><a name="x--Submit For Review and Final Edits"></a>Submit For Review and Final Edits</h3>
 <hr />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Submit the plan for review; </span><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">the project design status is now 35% complete so make a note on the tracking sheet.</span></strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> Edits to the sign plan must happen in three places: in the Access database, in ArcView, and in the pdf plan. If the number of edits are significant, you may consider replacing the old pdf with a new Illustrator file exported from ArcView once edits are made in ArcView and Access. Otherwise, if you are changing the messages for only a few signs, change the sign messaging in Access, and then edit the individual labels to match in Illustrator. Similarly, if you move a couple sign locations in ArcView, update the pdf to match. If you suspect your </span><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">documents</span></strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> are no longer synchronized, re-export the Illustrator pdf from the most current data in ArcView. A .pdf Field Review Sheet is placed in the project’s folder after completing the map.</span></li></ul>
