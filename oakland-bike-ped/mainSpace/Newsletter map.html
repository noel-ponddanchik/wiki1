<ol><li>Verify with Jason/Jennifer that the tBikeway_Segment database and the striping_status and signage_status spreadsheets have been updated.</li><li>Open and inspect the .mxd file at <span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">\\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Outreach\Newsletter\newsletter-maps\Bikeways_NewsletterMap.mxd </span></li><li>Update the bikeways_current xls in \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\GIS\bikeways by copying the QBikewaysCurrentGIS query from the BikewaySegments Access database in \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\GIS\bikeways\Segments-database. Save as a CSV and join to the bikeways layer in the mxd and copy the symbology using ExistingClass.</li><li>This should be automatic: the “Existing Class” is selected as the value field in the symbology section of the Bikeways layer, and the colors and line weights listed below are assigned.</li><li>Symbolize the completed and upcoming projects in yellow 17 and yogo blue, respectively.<ol><li>Insert if it's not in there already, the &quot;All_StripingProjects_2018&quot; layer located in \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\GIS\striping\Shapefiles\StripingShapefiles.gdb and SignProjects and &quot;SignProjects&quot; layer located in \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\GIS\master.gdb.</li><li>To mark the completed projects as yellow, sort both layers by completion date and symbolize those to be completed within the next 6 months with yogo blue 8 pt lines. <strong>(Don't change the transparency in ArcMap.</strong> Wait until Illustrator because it messes up the export.)</li><li>To mark the street segments with a project completed within the past 6 months as yellow, go to the bike segments access database located at \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\GIS\bikeways\Segments-database\BikewaySegments.accdb and sort by StripeInstallStripeInstallYear and StripeInstallMonth and choose the past six months then SignInstallYear and SignInstall Month and choose the past six months. For anything that was installed in the past six months, write down the ID numbers. However, <strong>this doesn't include redesigned projects</strong>. You must ask Jennifer for a list of redesigned projects and add those to the list. Check the segments you got from the database against \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Projects\!Tracking\tracking-striping-projects.xlsx and \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Projects\!Tracking\tracking-signage-projects.xlsx.<ol><li>Go back to ArcMap, copy another Bikeway Network layer that is also joined to the bikeways_current.xls and paste it, go to Layer Properties &gt; Definition Query and use the Query Builder to insert all the ID numbers you wrote down earlier. Example: &quot;GISADMIN.BikewayNetwork.ID = 132 OR GISADMIN.BikewayNetwork.ID = 563 OR GISADMIN.BikewayNetwork.ID = 564&quot;</li><li>Then tab to Symbology &gt; Single symbol and choose yellow 17 with 8 pt line.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Use the bookmark “1:50,000 extent” to reposition the map. Export it into Adobe Illustrator (.ai format) using RGB, vectorizing layers with bitmap marker fills. This file will group the layers. Do not check &quot;Use Display Expression for Item Name&quot;.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> Open the exported file and the bikeways newsletter map template at</span><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">\\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Outreach\Newsletter\newsletter-maps\Bikeways_NewsletterMap-template.ai</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">. In the Layers palette of the exported file, find the updated bikeways layer, hide or lock other layers, and then copy and paste it into the template. The layer should be positioned at 0-0, as measured from the upper left hand corner in the Transform palette. Save this revised file in the newsletter maps folder as “Bikeways_Newsletter_Map_Month/Year”</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Change the Opacity for the yellow and blue highlights to 60%</span><ol><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">You can select one highlight and click Select &gt; Same &gt; Stroke Color to select them all.</span></li></ol></li><li>For the yellow highlighted segments, add call outs including the street name with a translucent white box behind and graphic icons illustrating the type of project (new signs, new striping, improved striping, new paths, paving).<ol><li>Improvement type will be in the \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Projects\!Tracking\tracking-striping-projects.xlsx and \\oakland\pwa\Transportation\Bike-Ped_Program\Projects\!Tracking\tracking-signage-projects.xlsx completed projects tab. Use database information to check/compare with worksheet.</li><li>Use formatting of previous map for consistency. Look at previous maps to guide placement of the symbols.</li></ol></li><li>Submit to Jennifer for revisions.</li></ol><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Additional Tips:</span><br />
<ul><li>Working with Adobe Illustrator: This project involves some copy &amp; pasting items from one AI file to another. When you paste call out items into your new map group them before you paste them into the template so things can remain in order and be easily edited or deleted.</li><li>Lock Layers that are not being used.</li><li>Reposition labels so they are not covered by call out items.</li><li>Use the following colors and line-weights:<ul><li><span style="font-size: 12.7273px;"><span style="font-size: 12.7273px;">Class 1 (Bike Path) Color: Leaf Green (RGB 56-168-0 or #38a800</span>), Line Weight: 2</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12.7273px;">Class 2 (Bike Lane) Color: Mars R</span><span style="color: #080000;">ed (RGB 255-0-0 or #ff0000),</span> <span style="font-size: 12.7273px;">Line Weight: 2</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12.7273px;"><span style="font-size: 12.7273px;">Class 2.1 (Bike Lane one side only) Color: Mars Red <span style="color: #080000;">(RGB 255-0-0 or #ff0000)</span></span>, Line Weight: 1</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12.7273px;">Class 3 (Bike Route) Color: Electron Gold (RGB 255-170-0 or #ffaa00), Line Weight: 2</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12.7273px;">Class 3A (Arterial Bike Route) Color: Lapis Lazuli (RGB 0-92-230 or #005ce6), Line Weight: 2</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12.7273px;">Class 3B (Bicycle Boulevard) Color: Dark Amethyst (RGB 132-0-168 or #b400a8), Line Weight: 2</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12.7273px;">Class 4 (Protected Bike Lane) Color: Macaw Green, Line Weight: 2 </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12.7273px;">&lt;All Other Values&gt;, Two cartographic line symbols, Line Weight: 1.5</span></li></ul></li></ul>
