Bikeway classes are a categorization scheme to define the various types of bikeways. Each class has specific design characteristics that are fundamental to the planning, feasibility, design, and user experience of each facility type.<br />

<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">The City of Oakland's Bicycle Master Plan (2007) proposes a bikeway network of approximately 245 miles in length that is composed of five bikeway types:</span><br />
<ul><li>Bike Path (Class 1)</li><li>Bike Lane (Class 2)</li><li>Bike Route (Class 3)</li><li>Arterial Bike Route (Class 3A)</li><li>Bicycle Boulevard (Class 3B)</li></ul><br />
The Class 1, 2, and 3 bikeways are defined by the Caltrans Highway Design Manual, Chapter 1000. Oakland's Bicycle Master Plan adds Class 3A and 3B to this scheme. Three additional classes - Classes 0, 2.1, and 4 - are used for record keeping purposes (and they are defined below).<br />
<br />
The bikeway database tracks both existing and proposed bikeways, each in a separate field. Two fields are needed to capture all possible combinations, as suggested by these examples:<br />
<ul><li>A street with no bikeway (Existing Class 0) is proposed to get a bike lane (Proposed Class 2).</li><li>A street with an existing bike route (Existing Class 3) is proposed to be upgraded to a bike boulevard (Proposed Class 3B).</li><li>A street with an existing bike route (Existing Class 3) is proposed to be removed from the bike network (Proposed Class 0).</li></ul><br />

        <td>Either no bikeway exists or no bikeway is proposed for a particular roadway segment. For Existing Class 0, the Proposed Class is generally not 0. In some instances an existing bikeway (Existing Class does not equal 0) is proposed to be removed (Proposed Class 0). Segments with both Existing Class 0 and Proposed Class 0 were analyzed as part of the 2007 Bicycle Master Plan but not included as part of the bike network.<br />

</td>
        <td>This designation is used for one bike lane on only one side of a two-way street. Note that a one-way street with one bike lane is designated as Class 2. Class 2.1 is used to imply unfinished business - a bike lane is still needed on the street.<br />

</td>
        <td>Have shared travel lanes and are designated because they provide better connectivity than other nearby streets. Bike routes are designated with bikeway guide signs and may have no other bicycle-specific features. The 2007 Bicycle Master Plan proposes bike routes only in the Oakland Hills above Mountain Blvd due to the recreational nature and challenging topography of this area. The bikeways in the rest of the city are proposed for bikeways that provide a higher level of accommodation (Class 1, 2, 3B).<br />

        <td>Located on busier streets where bike lanes are not possible and parallel streets do not provide adequate connectivity. They include sharrows and bicycle-specific signage. Arterial bike routes are used to make near-term connections in the bike network. Over time they should be replaced with better facilities (e.g., Class 2).<br />
