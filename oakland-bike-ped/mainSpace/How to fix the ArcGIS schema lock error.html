The change in the network link for our data has created a recurring error in ArcGIS.<br />
<br />
&quot;failure to connect to database&quot;<br />
&quot;cannot acquire a scheme lock due to an existing lock&quot;<br />
<br />
The fix is done by accessing the .mxd file in ArcCatalog to repair the links.<br />
<br />
-first make sure no one is using ArcGIS on our team. If the geodatabase is being used you cannot make changes.<br />
<br />
-navigate to the map <br />
-right click the map<br />
-click on &quot;set data source&quot;<br />
-expand window<br />
-change the beginning of all of the old links from \\pwafile2\transportation to \\oakland\pwa\Transportation <br />
-a new map will be generated<br />
-open the new map to ensure the fix worked<br />
-then archive the old version in a &quot;old&quot; folder<br />
-change the name of the new version from &quot;copy&quot; to the intended name
